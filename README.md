# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected innerHTML Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the use of `innerHTML` in JavaScript within an HTML document.  The issue arises from how `innerHTML` is used to modify the content of an HTML element, specifically a div.

The original HTML code attempts to append new content to the div, using the existing innerHTML content for the div but this leads to unexpected behavior. The solution will show how to modify the code to produce the desired output.

## Bug

The `bug.html` file contains the code that exhibits this unusual behavior. The expected behavior is for the added paragraph to be displayed after the existing text. However, the actual outcome is that the existing content is unexpectedly overwritten or not rendered.
